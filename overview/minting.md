# Minting

Each bunny is a randomly generated bunny, to get your bunny you will need to participate in a ROLL. A ROLL is a process to churn your randomly generated bunny.

You might have gotten access to a ROLL via whitelisting or public minting, regardless every time you mint a bunny you will need to pay gas fees to mint. Gas fees are not paid to the project rather, it is paid to the Ethereum network of miners keeping the network running.

Each ROLL in our Public Sale costs **0.08 ETH**.
