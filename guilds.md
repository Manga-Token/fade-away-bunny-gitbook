# Guilds

Bunny holders can start new guilds and have people participate in their guilds. Guilds will need to clear participation hurdles in order to unlock different benefits.

A preview of what guilds can unlock:

* Guild based $PILL earning
* Boost breeding speed
* Discounts in the item shop
* Increase breeding success rates

We will reveal more perks as the guild feature gets unlocked.
