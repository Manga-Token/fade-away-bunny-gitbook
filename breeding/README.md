# Breeding

### Why breed new bunnies?

Increasing the number of bunnies directly increases the number of $PILL you can produce. Not only that, certain bunnies have traits that will lead to the production of more $PILL a day.

### How to breed?

Breeding a bunny is simple 3 step process:

#### STEP 1: Get a KNIFE!

Stake your bunny for 7 days and burn 1000 $PILL to mint 1 KNIFE.

#### STEP 2: Get a BED

Burn 10,000 $PILL at the [Item Shop](item-shop.md) to mint 1 BED

#### STEP 3: Breed

Stake 2 bunnies and 1 BED for **30 days** and burn 1 KNIFE to mint a new bunny. NOTE that bunny minting will not always be successful as with life there is always a chance that breeding might fail. You will immediately know if breeding is unsuccessful.
