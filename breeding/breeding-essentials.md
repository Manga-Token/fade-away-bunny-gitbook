# Breeding Essentials

Mentioned in the [breeding overview](./) you require a KNIFE and BED to breed.

### KNIFE

Can only be acquired through staking a bunny and burning 1,000 $PILL.

1 KNIFE will be burned per breeding process.

### BED

Can be acquired by buying directly from the Item Shop through burning 10,000 $PILL.

1 BED is required for the breeding process. The BED is a non-consumable item, hence will not be burned upon usage.
