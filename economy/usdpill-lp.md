# $PILL LP

In order to make it easier for bunny holders to grow the $PILL economy, the Manga Token team will be allocating a $MANGA fund to match any $PILL contribution into Uniswap.

What this means is that bunny holder will only need to stake $PILL in order to contribute to the Uniswap liquidity pool. Holders will no longer need to contribute a pair of $PILL and $MANGA in order to growth the Uniswap liquidity pool.

What you stand to gain as yield is a cut of the transaction fees on Uniswap for every $PILL traded.
