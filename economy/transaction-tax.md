# Transaction Tax

In order protect the $PILL economy and encourage HODLing, we are imposing the following taxation on every buy/transfer/sell transaction:

* 3% of every transaction is transferred into the Liquidity Pool on Uniswap to create a stable price floor.
* 2% of every transaction is used for strategic BuyBack & Burn.
* 3% of every transaction is sent to the [$MANGA Floor Price Fund](usdmanga-floor-price-fund.md).

A total of 8% is taxed on any transaction between two wallets.
