# $MANGA Floor Price Fund

Strengthening the Manga Token project will benefit all our sub-projects in the long haul.

To kickstart the $MANGA Floor Price Fund, we will be committing a portion of our proceeds of Fade Away Bunny to build up this fund.

**The breakdown is as follow:**

* 10% of our initial sale will go into the Floor Price Fund
* 50% of re-sale commission from any NFT marketplace like Opensea, Rarible, Mintable & of course [Trophee.xyz](https://trophee.xyz) will go into the Floor Price Fund

### What is this floor price fund?

#### Floor Price

The floor price is the price at which the fund will buy back $MANGA from the open market to burn. This is activated when the open market price falls below or reaches the floor price. The price at which $MANGA will be burned:

Floor price = 0.9 \* Capital / ($MANGA Circulating Supply)

The 0.9 factor leads to the floor price increasing as $MANGA is burnt.

An example to illustrate this:

* If there is 1000 USD of capital in the floor price fund and the total supply of $MANGA is 100, then 1 $MANGA can be burnt for 9 USD (0.9 \* 1000 / 100)
* The capital remaining in the floor price fund would be 991 USD, while the $MANGA circulating supply remaining would be 99
* After this burn, the floor price would now be 9.009 USD (0.9 \* 991 / 99)

#### Floor Price Fund

This fund will be made up primarily from 50% of the royalties earned from marketplaces. Our royalties will be set at 10% on Opensea and all other marketplaces. This means that 5% of any sale of the bunny on any marketplace will go into the floor price fund and the other 5% will go into continuous marketing and improvement of the Fade Away Bunny collections project.

To kick start the fund, we will allocated 10% of the proceeds of the initial Fade Away Bunny sale to the fund.

#### Increasing the Floor Price

Our goal is to increase the floor price which will directly help increase the price of $MANGA and $PILL.
